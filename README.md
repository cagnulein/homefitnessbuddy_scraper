I saw this message on the HFB site

> Update - April 2022
We're a bit behind on updating. Do people still see the need for this 
site/tool with the recent updates Peloton made to make class details 
available in the app (including PZ?) Send us an email and let us know.

So I guess it's a good idea to create a cache for all the PZ db.

I don't want to steal data, I just want to preserve the work of the HFB 
guys
